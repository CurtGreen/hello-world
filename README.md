Engaging the community in code and text

Hello World!

My name is Curtis Allyn Green, and I am a software developer that has been learning the ins and outs programming for a long time.
I have redoubled my efforts to improve my skills and bring value to the community of software development, as a whole, with my contributions.

A deep love for solving problems with logic has driven my quest for knowledge, and now I seek to apply that knowledge.
